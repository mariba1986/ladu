This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.5.
In order to run it, you need to install Angular by writing in npm install -g @angular/cli in your terminal. 

If you run into an error of "An unhandled exception occurred: ENOENT: no such file or directory" you may need to run "npm install" in the folder you're in. 
After that, the next step should work and open the current (front-end) status of our project.
